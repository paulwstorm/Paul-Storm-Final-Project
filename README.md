Hello! This is the repository for Weibo Clozed which was my capstone project for Project Shift's full-stack software development program.

If you would like to see the finished version of the project, it can be found [here](https://sleepy-garden-68724.herokuapp.com/).

If you are interested in running the application on your machine you need to clone the repository.

Then navigate into the project folder in your console. Run "npm install".

This project was build using React, so after the initial install navigate to the "client" folder and again run "npm install".

You will need to start the server by running the server.js file. 

Finally, navigate back to the "client" folder in your console and run the command "npm run". And you should see the project open in your browser.

If you have any questions, comments or recommendations. Feel free to contact me at: paulwwstorm@gmail.com.
